# multithread_radix_sort
A set of golang programs to play with the idea of using multithreading to create a fast, low-memory radix sort

I'm just having fun.  I answered an interview question over seven years ago and I recently made a tiktok about it.  I was asked "what is the most efficient sort algorithm"?  I asked what were the constraints and the interviewer(s) said: very constrained memory, huge data set, sorting numbers (I think they said 10 digits but for the sake of this test, I went with six digit numbers).  I said the radix sort, which they'd never heard of.  Needless to say, the interview didn't go well.  I thought I'd play with a radix sort, using minimum memory, for a various sizes of data sets, to see if I was correct in practice.
